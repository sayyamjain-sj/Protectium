# Protectium
Protectium - Web Based Multi Factor Authentication System

### Requirements :
Python 3, terminal or any IDE (vscode or pycharm), MySQL

### Introduction : 
Protectium is a web based multi-factor Authentication (MFA) system. It is an authentication method that requires the user to provide three verification factors to gain access to a resource such as an application, online account or any other transaction, which decreases the likelihood of a successful cyber attack. The project is aimed towards enhancing the relationship between customers and their private accounts, and thereby making it convenient for the customers to safely login to their respective accounts. The report contains the details of all the importance of a three factor authentication system. Formulated MFA for user convenience, strengthening the link between customers and their accounts, resulting in 25% more positive feedback and a
15% increase in engagement. Implemented three-factor authentication: an 8-character text password, a shape-based mechanism with 3 interactive shapes, and a user-driven graphical
password, increasing security metrics by 40%. Strengthened security through SQL data hashing, providing additional protection for user credentials and sensitive information during authentication,
resulting in 95% improved protection.
